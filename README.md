# Robot-Arm-

--OUTDATED-- check my Arm Mk3

C# serial powered, arduino based robot arm


I just pasted in raw files from different Verisons, I had on a old hard drive.
It worked by moving the mouse in a window, which then mapped the Position of the cursor and sent it to an Arduino via Serial comms.
I tried to save the Movements fluidly to an xml file and read it back to the Arm.
Many problems concerning the timing then showed up and I left the project.
